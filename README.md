# flowers
Generative design with Javascript, p5.js

A project for a generative design company requiring computer animated generative design to discontinue the need to pay artists to draw flowers. The company has previously been paying artists to draw the earth and flowers however, a solution that is cheaper and will provide more designs drawn is to have a generative design. The company wants to be able to draw water flowing from the earth and from the flowers. In order to change the design, the need a flower stroke button, drawing speed button and a water flow size. They will also require a button that can be clicked on to generate more drawings as well as a save button to save the photo.


#### The generative design company are interested in spirals shaped art and have given us shapes which are similar to what they are looking for:

#### Using these samples we have been able to use the style to create spiral shaped flowers

#### After this we need to add buttons to change the stroke size of the flower

#### This was done using stroke function. To create new flowers we used classes so we did not have to keep repeating code. After this we wanted to increase spiral speed with a sliding bar.

### This is so the generative design company can speed up the drawing process and produce more shapes and sizes quicker.

#### Next we add flow size sliding bar and new flower button to change the water flowing and to add more spiral flowers.

### After the company is happy with the art they can click save snapshot to save the picture.
